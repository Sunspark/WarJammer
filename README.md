Browser-based automated tables for Warhammer Quest

Some friends and I were playing Warhammer Quest (as a blast of nostalgia), and rolling tables is an arse. 
And I needed to learn to git.
And I wanted to teach them to program a bit.

This project is written in JavaScript, and tested using QUnit (which is .gitignored).

I haven't tested the project in anything other than Chrome, as this is a personal project.
